              The term “tech ninja” (and its first cousin “goth ninja”) has been
              banished from vernacular into the dungeon of cringe-inducing 2014
              fashion forum slang. Yet its essence covertly lives on, hijacking
              common perception of what techwear is and should be. Essentially,
              the massively complex terms is boiled down to a rudimentary—and
              highly conspicuous—silhouette of
              <span class="article__text--red">Acronym’s J1A-GT</span> zipped up
              over a face mask, grid-checked Guerrilla Group tank and a pair of
              P24s that some scoff at as “school shooter” wear.<br /><br />
              The role East Asia plays in proliferating and prolonging the “tech
              ninja” take on techwear is complex and echoes Japan’s reclaiming
              of cyberpunk. Japanese cyberpunk focuses less on the dramatic,
              tech-infused dystopias familiar to Western audiences and more on
              issues of dehumanization and invasiveness inflicted by technology
              and machinery on individuals, taking cues from Western body horror
              films like David Lynch’s
              <span class="article__text--red">Eraserhead</span> or David
              Cronenberg’s <span class="article__text--red">Videodrome</span>.
              <br /><br />
              What Japanese cyberpunk is internationally recognized for,
              however, are titles like Katsuhiro Otomo’s
              <span class="article__text--red">Akira</span> and Masamune
              Shirow’s
              <span class="article__text--red">Ghost in the Shell</span>, which
              married Western cyberpunk’s neon-lit cityscapes with the Japanese
              counterpart’s questions regarding humanity in the face of
              technology. The resounding success of Akira and Ghost in the Shell
              provided an entire generation with visual and conceptual
              inspiration. With an established homegrown link to Western
              cyberpunk, East Asian brands perhaps felt it appropriate to mix
              techwear with traditional dress to create increasingly exaggerated
              pieces befit more for screens than for real life.
