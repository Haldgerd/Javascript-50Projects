            Techno-orientalism helped birth speculative fiction and cyberpunk,
            which have undeniably influenced techwear’s development.
            Genre-defining works and their landscapes are ridden with East Asian
            references, from William Gibson’s dystopic take on Chiba in his
            novel Neuromancer to the Blade Runner franchise’s billboard geishas
            and Japanese- and Chinese-littered signage and even video game Deux
            Ex: Human Revolution’s reimagining of the currently pastoral Hengsha
            Island into a two-story megacity. <br /><br /><br />
            The role East Asia plays in proliferating and prolonging the “tech
            ninja” take on techwear is complex and echoes Japan’s reclaiming of
            cyberpunk. Japanese cyberpunk focuses less on the dramatic,
            tech-infused dystopias familiar to Western audiences and more on
            issues of dehumanization and invasiveness inflicted by technology
            and machinery on individuals, taking cues from Western body horror
            films like David Lynch’s Eraserhead or David Cronenberg’s
            Videodrome. <br /><br /><br />

            What Japanese cyberpunk is internationally recognized for, however,
            are titles like Katsuhiro Otomo’s Akira and Masamune Shirow’s Ghost
            in the Shell, which married Western cyberpunk’s neon-lit cityscapes
            with the Japanese counterpart’s questions regarding humanity in the
            face of technology. The resounding success of Akira and Ghost in the
            Shell provided an entire generation with visual and conceptual
            inspiration. With an established homegrown link to Western
            cyberpunk, East Asian brands perhaps felt it appropriate to mix
            techwear with traditional dress to create increasingly exaggerated
            pieces befit more for screens than for real life.
